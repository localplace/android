Functional Reactive Concepts

Functional Programming Concepts :- making it predictable and thread safe 

a) Pure Functions  :- with no sideeffects 

// with same set of parameters will get same result every time example SideEffectIllustration.java 


b) functions as first class citizens

c) High Order functions  :- functions that return other functions 



Reactive Programming Concepts

a) Reactive Manifesto :- Event Driven, works well with concurrency and decouple certain modules from each other 

b) Make applications scalable.
