Functional Reactive Concepts

Functional Programming Concepts :- making it predictable and thread safe 

a) Pure Functions  :- with no sideeffects 

1) with same set of parameters will get same result every time example SideEffectIllustration.java 

a)No sideeffect caused by Class or Instance state

b)No sideeffect effects caused by I/O devices

c) No time related side effects.

Functions as first class citizens
a) FirstClassCitizenParameterIllustration.java and FirstClassCitizenVariableIllustration.java

1) Variables may contain functions 
2) funcation can be passed as parameters 


High Order functions  :- functions that return other functions 

functions that take functions and return a composite functions.

Reactive Programming Concepts

a) Reactive Manifesto :- Event Driven, works well with facilitates concurrency and decouple certain modules from each other , maintainable and extensible.

Event driven :- Observer Pattern 

a) Observable 

b) observers, these subscribe themenselves to the observables. then any changes to the obseravable are sent to the observers as notifications.

Obseravable<T> a particular type of events, Observer will observe that event. 

Event of type T, then that notification is sent to each observer.


for example

Observable<User> returns a list of users. Observer will filter out users that is not an admin. Rxjava has lot of schedulers, that handles the threading for us.

sends to 

grouping of users can be done serialized 

sends to
map orm user to json 	


b) Make applications scalable.

Scalable, if there is more load, then we need to create new instances of our applications

as they are done in parallel, so it becomes a faster way in executing


c) applications resilient to changes in load

if there are failures, services goes down, we want apps to ahndle gracefully.

Graceful Error Handling.
if a failing system had impact on other elements of our system.  

d)Responsive
Maximum use of available resources.

Observable Data Models :- MVVM pattern , when data modesls are updated , then view models are updated , ui is refreshed.

Users generate streams of events by their actions
