Functional Reactive Concepts

Functional Programming Concepts :- making it predictable and thread safe 

a) Pure Functions  :- with no sideeffects 

1) with same set of parameters will get same result every time example SideEffectIllustration.java 

a)No sideeffect caused by Class or Instance state

b)No sideeffect effects caused by I/O devices

c) No time related side effects.

Functions as first class citizens
a) FirstClassCitizenParameterIllustration.java and FirstClassCitizenVariableIllustration.java

1) Variables may contain functions 
2) funcation can be passed as parameters 


High Order functions  :- functions that return other functions 

functions that take functions and return a composite functions.

Reactive Programming Concepts

a) Reactive Manifesto :- Event Driven, works well with concurrency and decouple certain modules from each other 

b) Make applications scalable.

c) applications resilient to changes in load
